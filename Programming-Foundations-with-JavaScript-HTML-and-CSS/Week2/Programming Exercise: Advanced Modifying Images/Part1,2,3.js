//Part 3
/*
 * Write a function named setBlack that has one parameter pixel (representing a single pixel)
 * and returns pixel with its red, green, and blue components changed so that the pixelâ€™s color is black.
 */

/*
 * On the left, we have the original image, and on the right, we have modified the image by giving
 * it a black border that is 10 pixels thick. Note that the image size of the image with the border
 * is the same as the original image because the border is not added around the outside of the original
 * image, instead it covers up some of the original image.
 
 * Work through the seven steps to write this function. Work an example by hand and note the steps you
 * took before translating your algorithm to code. Which pixels should be part of the border? How will
 * you identify those pixels? Once you have identified them, how will you make them black?

 * Now you will write another function named addBorder. This function will add a black border to an 
 * image, such as in the following example:
